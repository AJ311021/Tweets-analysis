At the same time, a false positive would lead to an unnecessary actions — incurring additional cost.\n",

    "A random forest is a machine learning technique that’s used to solve regression and classification problems. It utilizes ensemble learning, which is a technique that combines many classifiers to provide solutions to complex problems. A random forest algorithm consists of many decision trees. The ‘forest’ generated by the random forest algorithm is trained through bagging or bootstrap aggregating. Bagging is an ensemble meta-algorithm that improves the accuracy of machine learning algorithms. The (random forest) algorithm establishes the outcome based on the predictions of the decision trees. It predicts by taking the average or mean of the output from various trees. Increasing the number of trees increases the precision of the outcome. This is more advanced method and would be compared to the simpler ones discussed above."

    "* Comparing 3 models with unprocessed data it can be seen that the baseline Logistic Regression model performed the best. The highest Recall is obtained here. Especially after the hyperparameters tuning.\n",
    "* Analysing all the models, the hyperparameters tuning generally helped to improve the performance for all the models, so it is very important step.\n",
    "* The elapsed real time, real time, wall-clock time, or wall time is the actual time taken from the start of a computer program to the end. In other words, it is the difference between the time at which a task finishes and the time at which the task started. Analysing the wall time it can be seen that KNN model was the fastest in training, while in predicting Logistic Regresssion was better. Random Forest was the slowest, as it is more complicated process.\n",
    "* The faster training of KNN can be explained by the fact that it is a non-parametric and lazy learning algorithm. Non-parametric means there is no assumption for underlying data distribution. In other words, the model structure determined from the dataset. This will be very helpful in practice where most of the real world datasets do not follow mathematical theoretical assumptions. Lazy algorithm means it does not need any training data points for model generation. All training data used in the testing phase. This makes training faster and testing phase slower and costlier. "
