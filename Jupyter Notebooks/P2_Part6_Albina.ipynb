    "* Interestingly, for Logistic Regression model application of the combined data preprocessing techniques decreased the evaluation parameters of model. This can be explained by the important feature removal, which for this specific model made the performance worse.\n",
    "* For KNN though the results improved significantly.\n",
    "* While for Random Forest with the expect of only precision, the other parameters such as accuracy, f1score and recall are much higher for processed data than unprocessed one. As it was explained before recall is very important parameter and Random Forest has the highest recall (0.736) among all models and observed cases of data processing so far. Thus, this is the best model for this task for now. "
