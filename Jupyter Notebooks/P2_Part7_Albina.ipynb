    "In this part Bag of words and TFIDF will be compared. Bag of Words just creates a set of vectors containing the count of word occurrences in the document (reviews), while the TF-IDF model contains information on the more important words and the less important ones as well. TFIDF stands for “Term Frequency — Inverse Document Frequency”. Term Frequency (tf): gives us the frequency of the word in each document in the corpus. It is the ratio of number of times the word appears in a document compared to the total number of words in that document. It increases as the number of occurrences of that word within the document increases. Inverse Data Frequency (idf): used to calculate the weight of rare words across all documents in the corpus. The words that occur rarely in the corpus have a high IDF score. Combining these two we come up with the TF-IDF score (w) for a word in a document in the corpus."

    "* It can be seen that for Logistic Regression there was no large difference in results between tfidf and bag of words, and Recall was even lower in tfidf one. So for this model bag of words is more preferable.\n",
    "* For KNN although precision was higher with tfidf, the recall is still lower, which is not favorable as the focus is to improve the recall firstly.\n",
    "* For Random forest the results are similar and recall is higher for bag of words case, so again bag of words is more preferable then over tfidf in this case.\n",
    "* Such effect of tfidf can be explained by more processing of data that is done by tfidf and as the result the removal possible important keywords for models."
