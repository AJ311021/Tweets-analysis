    "* As it can be seen an interesting effect of data preprocessing was observed on Logistic Regression model, where modeling the  preprocessed data showed worse performance than in the unprocessed case. This can be explained by the removal of important features which actually reduced performance. It is importnat to consider that tweets are often informal language, so preprocessing could remove a lot of valuable features (punctutaion, numbers, etc.), which are useful for this model.\n",
    "* In other models KNN and Random Forest the performance incerased slightly or stayed almost same, in contrast. So the removal of features helped the models to predict better based on the words only.\n",
    "* Analysing the wall time it can be seen that as in the previous case, KNN model was the fastest in training, while in predicting Logistic Regresssion was better. Random Forest was the slowest, as it is more complicated process."
